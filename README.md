# inventory-log-analysis & Dashboard Project
This project focuses on analyzing inventory logs for monitoring inventory adjustments, stock-outs, product-level trends, and supplier activities. This dashboard empowers stakeholders to identify inefficiencies, reduce stockout rates, and improve inventory management processes.

## Objectives
To gain insights from raw inventory logs and create a dynamic PowerBI dashboard that Highlights:
   - Total Out of stock
   - Manual adjustments
   - Stock movement trend
   - Product Performance

## Dataset Overview

     - 'change type'
     - 'quantity changed'
     - 'stock after change'

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Skills Applied

| Tool                        | Purpose                                   |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **SQL**                     | Data cleaning, transaformation and initial analysis |
|   **PowerBI** Power Query               | Data type correction, Column renaming, and new calculated columns     |
|   **PowerBI** Data Modeling               | Defined relationships between tables     |
|   **PowerBI** DAX               | Created custom measures (e.g out of stock rate, adjustment count etc)     |


## üßπ Data Processing Workflow


1. **üìÇSQL Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Removed duplicates
   - Standardize date and time formats
   - Segregated date parts ( 'Year', 'Month' 'Day' 'AM/PM')
   - Identified null values and cleaned inconsistencies
   - Standardize change type and derived stock after change
   - Categorized numerical ratings into human-readable labels
   - Normalize text case for consistency in product_name and category
   - Calculated `Total Inventory Changes per Product`, `Manual Adjustments per Product`, and `Stockouts per Product`,`Inventory Changes by Date`,`Time-Based Inventory Patterns` 

All data transformation steps were written in SQL and are available here:

üëâ [data_cleaning_and_analysis.sql]E_com inventoryLog.sql

  

3. **Loading into Power BI**
   - Imported cleaned SQL views or queries
   - Created DAX measures like:
     - `Stockout Rate (%)`
     - `Total Manual Adjustments`
     - `Daily Stock-Out Count`

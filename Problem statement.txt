We suspect that some products are frequently going out of stock or being adjusted manually, but we donâ€™t know which ones or why. 
We need help identifying products with the highest number of 
inventory changes, especially manual adjustments and stockouts...so we can investigate and improve inventory planning.

Stakeholder: Inventory Manager

Objectives
1. Analyze inventory logs
2. Spot patterns in stockouts and manual adjustments
3. Highlight the products most affected
